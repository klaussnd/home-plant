# An automatic watering system for home plants

An open source automatic plant watering system for pot plants in your home.
The system has been employed successfully in my home for several years.
It has a modular design and consists of a measurement module, an irrigation module, and a control module.
A full description as well as some theoretical background can be found [in this paper](http://kschn.users.sf.net/home-plant.pdf).

This repository will contain hardware, firmware, and software utilities.
I am currently in the process of extracting all relevant code from my private repositories.
For now, the repository already contains the hardware.
Code will follow soon.
